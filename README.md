## Description

This is a CLI svg generator. It was made with node.js using the inquirer package.

## Installation

Requires nodejs and inquirer. Extract or clone the repo using

    git clone git@github.com:stanjosh/md-gen.git

 From the newly created directory, run npm install to install dependencies (inquirer and jest).


## Usage

Run 

    node index.js     
    
or 

    node .
